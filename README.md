# TASK 1:Write pseudo code that reads two numbers and multiplies them together and print out their product.
Start
print "Enter the first number "
read number1
print "Enter the second number"
read number2
Multiplication  = number1 * number2
print "The product of", number1, "*", number2, "=" , multiplication
End
# 2. Write pseudo code that tells a user that the number they entered is not a 5 or a 6.
Start
Print “Enter the number”
If number != 5 and number !=6 then
Print “The number you entered is not a 5 0r 6”
else
Print “The number you entered is either a 5 or 6”
End
# 3: Write pseudo code that performs the following: Ask a user to enter a number. If the number is between 0 and 10, write the word blue. If the number is between 10 and 20, write the word red. if the number is between 20 and 30, write the word green. If it is any other number, write that it is not a correct color option.
Start
Print “Enter a number”
If number is  <10 then
Print ” blue”
Esle
If number is >10 and number <20 then
Print ”red”
else If number is >20 and number <30 then
Print “green”
Esle
Print “Not a correct color option”
End
